*Security practitioners will leverage PACE to evaluate their organization's overall state of cybersecurity readiness*

9 December 2021 — The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA), a global, ​standards-based initiative to simplify ​​integration across the threat lifecycle, announced today that it has accepted the Posture Attribute Collection and Evaluation ([PACE](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE)) project contributed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the National Security Agency (NSA) and McAfee. PACE will focus on creating production-ready code that evaluates the posture assessment of computing resources using a communication fabric which will allow organizations to use this information in zero-trust architecture decisioning.

Based on an implementation effort from the IETF Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring ([SACM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/about/)) architecture, PACE will deliver community-maintained code that will arm operators with an interoperable out-of-the-box solution that monitors risk and threat exposure, reducing integration costs and redundancy while increasing resiliency. Providing comprehensive views into the endpoint, PACE will take advantage of existing standards such as SCAPv2 and leverage ongoing work in SBOM, to allow cybersecurity practitioners to fully utilize threat-informed defenses in their environment in an open and interoperable fashion.

The PACE project aligns with the OCA’s mission of integrating tools and solutions across security teams and will directly enable vendors and end users, advancing the OCA’s mission of building an open ecosystem where cybersecurity products interoperate without the need for customized integrations.

“NSA Cybersecurity is proud to have supported the development of the OASIS standard [OpenC2](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2) language for command and control, which has been included in PACE. Additionally, PACE will leverage several of the cybersecurity standardization efforts NSA has been working on with industry partners to improve the cybersecurity of National Security Systems, the Department of Defense and the Defense Industrial Base.”
_— Neal Ziring, Cybersecurity Technical Director, National Security Agency_

PACE joins other OCA projects that include Kestrel, the threat hunting tool, the STIX Shifter patterning library, and the OCA Ontology.

The OCA is hosted by OASIS Open, one of the most respected, international bodies in the world for open source and standards.

The team here at CyberNB and our Critical Infrastructure Protection Network (CIPnet) will benefit from the PACE project and its outcomes.”
_– Tyson Johnson, CEO, CyberNB | CIPnet_

### Cydarm Technologies
“PACE is an important addition to the OCA project portfolio, as it enables faster gathering of context around intrusion alerts, enabling responders to more quickly triage possible incidents and reduce time wasted on repetitive queries across disconnected systems. Cydarm looks forward to integrating PACE, to further our goal of enabling better and faster security operations.”
_– Dr. Vaughan Shanks, CEO, Cydarm Technologies_

### Cyware Labs
“Cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving, making it essential for organizations to have complete visibility over their current security posture and the environment they are striving to protect. At Cyware, we facilitate the goal of collective defense for all organizations and communities through collaborative threat response and threat intelligence sharing. PACE, an OCA project will steer the community towards a collaborative framework, enabling them to have the right visibility over the security posture of any organization.”
_– Avkash Kathiriya, VP – Research and Innovation, Cyware Labs_

### EclecticIQ
“EclecticIQ and the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) share a common belief that an open ecosystem improves cybersecurity for everyone. Our open and extensible platform makes it easy to use and share intelligence from multiple sources to detect threats earlier, remediate incidents faster, and run operations more efficiently. We applaud the OCA for driving industry-wide cooperation on protocols and standards surrounding sharing cybersecurity insights and findings.”
_– Ciaran Bradley, CTO, EclecticIQ_

### F5 Inc.
“Effectively sketching the cybersecurity posture of organizations to practically combat cyber threats requires the power of both enterprise and open-source tools to build a coherent and vigorous cyber defense platform. Fusion and integration of security products including information exchange with the PACE project in the OCA ecosystem not only helps the organizations to subvert cyber threats at scale by generating efficient threat intelligence but also helps to build a proactive and robust cybersecurity stance. In fact, that’s the need of the hour for organizations to provide a secure and safe digital transformation environment to customers.”
_– Renuka Nadkarni, CTO Security, F5 Inc._

### IBM Security
“Posture assessment is foundational for any zero-trust based approach to security. Having open and interoperable implementation of existing posture standards is critical to ensuring that innovations in this space can be effectively implemented by the broader community, and bringing the PACE project into the OCA will help the industry realize that goal.”
_– Jason Keirstead, Senior Technical Staff Member and the Chief Architect of Threat Management, IBM Security_

### McAfee
“The state of a system at the time of an event is of utmost importance in an event driven system, perhaps as important as the event itself. Without this context, we cannot determine if an event is of high or low critical importance or what the resulting action should be to a given event. Posture attributes that we can broadly agree on as well as open tooling for the collection and evaluation of those attributes is a great move forward in making open, interoperable and event-driven cybersecurity a reality.”
_– Mark Mastrangeli, Lead Technology Architect, McAfee_

### Rapid7
“Visibility is the cornerstone of cybersecurity. Being able to measure and effectively communicate the posture/state of business process assets fosters better (and faster) decision making and can significantly improve enterprise safety and resilience. By creating and relying on open standards for data storage and interchange and removing the need for vendors to reinvent the wheel on commodity architecture components, PACE will help bring security automation and continuous monitoring (SACM) to the widest possible audience, arming organizations of any size with the core components necessary to maintain the health of their IT ecosystems.”
_– Bob Rudis, Chief Security Data Scientist, Rapid7_

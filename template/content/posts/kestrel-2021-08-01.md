In our [previous blog post]() we showed how to get started with the Kestrel Threat Hunting Language, such as connecting to data sources and performing your first hunts using the `GET` and `FIND` commands. In this post, we'll introduce the `APPLY` keyword, which adds powerful analytics and enrichment capabilities to hunts.

*We will show a
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) hunt
performing backward and forward tracking on a Windows host to unearth the root
cause and impact of activities related to an IP address. We will walk the process
tree and extend analysis to network traffic and IP addresses. We use
both pattern matching and analytic hunting steps and chain them into
huntflows.*

### <a name="section:setup"></a>Kestrel Installation And Monitoring System Setup

If you're unfamiliar with setting up Kestrel for your environment, start by reviewing our previous blog [Building A Huntbook to Discovery Persistent Threats from
Scheduled Windows Tasks](/posts/kestrel-2021-07-01). There you will find the steps to monitor a Windows host
with [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon),
stream the log data to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) via
[winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html),
[install Kestrel](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
in a Python virtual environment, and install the and configure the [STIX-shifter](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kestrel_datasource_stixshifter.interface.html) *elastic_ecs* connector to access the log data.

### <a name="section:startip"></a>Entity-based Reasoning From An IP Address

Sysmon traces Windows activities and stores individual events as
[records](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#record) in
Elasticsearch. Reasoning on records directly requires excessive knowledge of
record semantics, which gets worse when querying multiple data sources with
different record formats. The Kestrel runtime identifies
[entities](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity) in
records and automatically collects all available information about entities in
related records before presenting the complete view to the user.
We only need to hunt in terms of entities, e.g., creating a [Kestrel
variable](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#kestrel-variable)
from an IP address and
[finding](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find) all
processes connected to that IP address. This [entity-based hunting
approach](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity-based-reasoning)
makes it easy for a human to organize hunts, pivot from one hunt step to
another, and enables [composable huntflow
development](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow).

In this tutorial, we will start from the IP address `72.21.81.200` and walk
the associated process tree to reason about whether the IP address is suspicious.

First, let's create a Kestrel variable starting from the IP address as an entity:

```elixir
ip200 = GET ipv4-addr FROM stixshifter://host101
        WHERE [ipv4-addr:value = '72.21.81.200']
        START t'2021-04-01T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2021-04-06T00:00:00Z'
```

We specify the type of entity `ipv4-addr` we would like to get from the monitored
Windows host `host101` and describe the matching criteria using the STIX Pattern
`[ipv4-addr:value = '72.21.81.200']`. We limit the time of search for the first
5 days in April to limit our search. The time range is required in
our first `GET` command in a huntflow to set the scope. Otherwise, STIX-shifter defaults to the past five minutes.

If you have setup multiple data sources besides `host101`, you can use
auto-complete in Kestrel to list all available data sources by pressing `TAB`
after `stixshifter://`.

![Kestrel first block execution
summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ip200_summary.png)

After putting the command in a Jupyter cell and executing it, we get a
summary for the code block---one IP address entity and 350 records/logs, each of
which has some information about the IP. We don't bother with the number of
records since we are doing entity-based reasoning and Kestrel will assemble the
entity from the 350 records for us.

### <a name="section:ip2process"></a>Obtaining Associated Network-Traffic And Processes

As a threat hunter, we are often interested in knowing not just which systems, but also which processes connect to an IP address that might be suspicious. To do this, we must obtain the an entity that sits between them---*network-traffic*. The Kestrel
entity ontology is based on [STIX
SCOs](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html#_Toc16070567),
and it is described in the [FIND command
syntax](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find), which is
used to get connected entities, e.g., `ipv4-addr` entities to
`network-traffic` entities; `network-traffic` entities to `process` entities, and so on.

According to the relation chart in the [FIND command
syntax](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find), we use
`ACCEPTED BY` relation to indicate the IP addresses in `ip200` are the destination IPs of
the `network-traffic` returned. We then use `CREATED` relation to indicate
the `network-traffic` is associated with the `process` to be returned. The `DISP`
command will print select attributes of the entities in a Kestrel variable without side effects. Now
let's put all four commands together into a code block to be executed in a Jupyter
Notebook cell:

```elixir
# obtain network traffic that has ip200 as the destination IP
ip200nt = FIND network-traffic ACCEPTED BY ip200
DISP ip200nt ATTR src_ref.value, src_port, dst_ref.value, dst_port

# obtain processes creating the network traffic
p = FIND process CREATED ip200nt
DISP p ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

We get back 350 network traffic entries in `ip200nt` and 34 processes in `p`. Here is a
partial list of the network traffic entities in `ip200nt` out of the 350 entities.

![Kestrel network traffic detailed
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ip200nt_details.png)

We may want to list only the distinguished destination port to get an idea
of whether this is just HTTPS (port 443) traffic. We can execute another `DISP`
command in an empty cell. If we are not sure which attributes to list, we can
always do `INFO ip200nt` first.

```elixir
DISP ip200nt ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel network traffic brief
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ip200nt_brief.png)

Kestrel automatically deduplicates repeated results yielding a single unique entry, which confirms our guess that all traffic going to the IP is to its
port 443.

Looking at the second output from our previously executed block, the `DISP
p` command shows an abridged list of the 34 associated processes:

![Kestrel first process detailed
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_p_results.png)

We discovered all 34 processes in the Kestrel variable `p` connected to `72.21.81.200:443`. We can pick up the first process `BackgroundDownload.exe` to start
walking the process tree to further our understanding of the activities on the Windows
host.

### <a name="section:backtracking"></a>Walking Up The Process Tree of *BackgroundDownload.exe*

Backward tracking is a hunting strategy to walk back the control-flow or
data-flow of entities to understand their origin or provenance. The most common
task for process entities is to backtrack their control-flow and *walk up
the process tree* to check whether given processes are created by a malicious
or potentially compromised process.

Let's take a close look at a subset of processes with the name
`BackgroundDownload.exe` in `p`. From their command line we can guess they are
benign and belong to Microsoft Visual Studio. Let's check their parent process
to verify this.

```elixir
# get a subset of entities from variable `p`
bgdownloads = GET process FROM p WHERE [process:name = 'BackgroundDownload.exe']

# obtain parent processes of bgdownloads
bgdp = FIND process CREATED bgdownloads
DISP bgdp ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel parent process bgdp detailed
results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_bgdp_results.png)

We get four `BackgroundDownload.exe` processes from `p` and three processes as their
parent processes. From the parent process names and executable paths, we are
more confident `BackgroundDownload.exe` processes are part of Microsoft Visual
Studio and spawned by processes from the suite.

Next, let's see if we can trace back one level to find the grandparent
processes:

```elixir
# grandparent processes of `BackgroundDownload.exe`
bgdpp = FIND process CREATED bgdp
```

![Kestrel parent process bgdpp
summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_bgdpp_summary.png)

Good, we see two processes, and Kestrel also gets back some records with network
activities when trying to get the most complete information of the
entities---there are 146 *network-traffic* records related to the two
processes. However, this is only a summary of the command execution, and we are
not sure whether the *network-traffic* entities are directly or indirectly linked to the
grandparent processes. Let's print out details of the grandparent processes and
the network traffic:

```elixir
DISP bgdpp ATTR pid, name, command_line

bgdppnt = FIND network-traffic CREATED BY bgdpp
DISP bgdppnt ATTR src_ref.value, src_port, dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel parent process bgdpp
details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_bgdpp_details.png)

Zero network activities: the 146 related `network-traffic` records cached could
be indirectly associated with the process in `bgdpp` such as their parent or
child processes.


It is easy to guess the `devenv.exe` in `bgdp` is spawned from `explorer.exe`
in `bgdpp` (likely a double click by a human user); `svchost.exe` is spawned
from `services.exe`. We can choose the former to verify:

```elixir
bgdp_devenv = GET process FROM bgdp WHERE [process:name = 'devenv.exe']
bgdp_devenv_parent = FIND process CREATED bgdp_devenv
DISP bgdp_devenv_parent ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel process devenv
details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_devenv_details.png)

Bingo. And we can walk the process chain up of `bgdp_devenv_parent`:

```elixir
# Let's go further up to pull out parent process of `bgdp_devenv_parent`.
ppp = FIND process CREATED bgdp_devenv_parent
DISP ppp ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel process devenv_parent_
details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_devenv_parent_details.png)

The `explorer.exe` is spawned by `svchost.exe -k DcomLaunch -p`, which is the
Windows DCOM Server Process Launcher and this behavior is expected. The DCOM
launcher is the *great grandparent* of `BackgroundDownload.exe` and it is one
of the core Windows system services. We could stop here, but we can also try to
trace back further to see what is the limit of the Sysmon monitor regarding its
visibility into the very early phases of system bootup---of course, Sysmon can
only see things after it is started/spawned itself by a Windows service process.

```elixir
# Let's see how far we can go to the origin of the process tree in sysmon
pppp = FIND process CREATED ppp
DISP pppp ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel process pppp
summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_pppp_summary.png)

OK. We just hit the limit of Sysmon, which does not log the birth of
`ppp`.

### <a name="section:forwardtracking"></a>Forward Tracking From *iexplore.exe*

After backward tracking and finding some interesting branches in the process
tree, we can perform forward tracking, or *walk down the tree*, to check other
activities from the entities. This is a common hunting strategy to
understand impacts of an entity.

We start from processes that talk to IP address `72.21.81.200`, and we already
have all such processes in variable `p`. Let's list all process names in `p`:

```elixir
DISP p ATTR name
```

![Kestrel process p names](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_p_names.png)

In the last section, we hunt mostly around `BackgroundDownload.exe` and we can
walk down the process tree from its parent process in `bgdp`. We can also go
beyond the process tree by forward tracking and impact analysis, e.g., finding network
traffic and IP addresses associated with processes.

Let's try it: start from the `iexplore.exe` processes in the above list to (i)
walk down its process tree, and (ii) go beyond the process tree to network
activities at leaf processes.

```elixir
# first walk down the tree from the iexplore processes in `p`
ie = GET process FROM p WHERE [process:name = 'iexplore.exe']
DISP ie ATTR pid, name, command_line

ie_children = FIND process CREATED BY ie
DISP ie_children ATTR pid, name, command_line
```

![Kestrel ie details](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ie_and_children.png)

As shown in the execution summary, the Kestrel variable `ie` contains two process
entities with pids 7356 and 11368. There is only one process in `ie_children`
with pid 8508.

```elixir
# second let's go beyond the process tree for network activities of the child process
ient = FIND network-traffic CREATED BY ie_children
DISP ient ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel ie child network traffic](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ie_child_nt.png)

### <a name="section:analytics"></a>Entity Enrichment With Kestrel Analytics

We find 76 network traffic entities from the IE process with pid 8508 shown
above, all of which looks like web connections. However, could a malicious C&C
sever be hiding in the list? Usually attackers do not use IP addresses
directly for C&C, but domain names created by domain generation algorithms
(DGA). If we can enrich the IP addresses with their domain names, we may
discover something malicious.

Enriching entities is another type of hunting steps besides pattern matching,
and Kestrel enables it via *analytics*---the second way of encoding hunting
knowledge besides patterns.

The analytic we use here is
[domainnamelookup](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/analytics/domainnamelookup)
in the [Kestrel analytics
repository](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics). It
is a Kestrel analytic executed via the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) interface. To use
the analytics, first clone the repo and go to the _domainnamelookup_ analytics
directory. Then do docker build:

```bash
$ docker build -t kestrel-analytics-enrichdomain .
```

The analytic is now available as *enrichdomain* in Kestrel. Kestrel calls
analytics using the `APPLY` command (more details in
[documentation](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#apply)).
After typing `APPLY docker://`, we can press `TAB` to list all available
analytics. If *enrichdomain* does not show up, restart the Jupyter kernel to
re-initialize the Kestrel kernel and its analytics interface manager.

```elixir
# next let's apply the analytics to all entities in `ient`.
APPLY docker://enrichdomain ON ient

# print out all attributes including the ones added/enriched by `enrichdomain`
INFO ient
```

![Kestrel ie child network
traffic](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ient_details.png)

Looking for attributes about domain names, we find two attributes newly added by
the analytic: *x_domain_name* and *x_domain_organization*. We can print:

```elixir
DISP ient ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port, x_domain_name, x_domain_organization
```

![Kestrel ie child network
traffic domains](/images/kestrel/2021-07-08_ient_domains.png)

No domain names here appear to be generated by naive DGA (examples from the
article [Domain Generation Algorithms -- Why so
effective?](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/domain-generation-algorithms-effective)).
Not bad to rule out a threat.

### Stretch Hunts

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial on how to use the Kestrel Threat Hunting Language to extend your searches and pivot between entoty types to perform provenance tracking and impact analysis.
More can be done by backward and forward tracking control-flow (through the
process tree) and data-flow (through files) and applying other analytics in the
hunts, and we hope to bring more powerful capabilities in future releases.

1. Kestrel 1.0 has only process--executable relation for files, which is not
   very powerful for data-flow tracking. In the future Kestrel will support STIX 2.1
   with SROs including universal file type support for more powerful data-flow
   tracking.

2. In the [Kestrel analytics
   repository](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics),
   there is an example analytic [SANS IP
   Enrichment](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/analytics/sansipenrich)
   that enriches network traffic entities with IOC information provided by
   [SANS](https://isc.sans.edu/api/#openiocsources).

3. It is easy to build your own analytics, and more information can be found
   with the [analytics
   template](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-analytics/tree/release/template)
   for the Kestrel docker analytics interface. Watch our for a future blog post!

Until next time, happy threat hunting!

In this blog post, the first in a series introducing the Kestrel Threat Hunting Language,
we will show you how to get started with your first hunt. You'll learn how to set up your
environment, connect to data sources, and search for a common attack technique, [scheduled tasks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/) in Windows. You'll also become familiar with the basic concepts that you can use to build your own huntbooks.

Let's setup our monitoring stack and perform a
[Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) hunt
for persistent Windows threats by reasoning over Scheduled Windows Tasks.

### Kestrel Installation

First, we will follow the [Kestrel Installation
Guideline](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and
install Kestrel in a Python virtual environment on a Linux hunting box with
Python 3.9.

Next, create a clean Python virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
$ python -m venv huntingspace
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
```

Next, install Kestrel runtime with its Jupyter notebook kernel:
```bash
$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install kestrel-jupyter
$ python -m kestrel_jupyter_kernel.setup
```

This step will install all Kestrel runtime components and dependencies such as
[STIX-shifter](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter) as
well as [Jupyter Server](https://jupyter.org/) to use the Kestrel kernel.

### Setting up Data Sources

Most organizations use an EDR to monitor their Windows hosts and collect telemetry data over we can use use Kestrel to reason. In this demo we will use
[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and
use
[winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/master/winlogbeat-module-sysmon.html)
to stream events into [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for log
management. Logs in Elasticsearch are
[records](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#record), on
top of which Kestrel provides an abstraction to do [entity-based
reasoning](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#entity-based-reasoning)
and enables dynamic
[huntflow](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow)
development and sharing.

Kestrel connects to data sources with an extensible set of
[interfaces](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#data-and-analytics-interfaces).
The primary one we will use today is the [STIX-shifter
interface](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kestrel_datasource_stixshifter.interface.html).
STIX-shifter enables data retrieval from various data sources, including data
in [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/ecs) stored on an Elasticsearch server (used by winlogbeat). STIX-shifter has dozens of [connectors](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/blob/develop/OVERVIEW.md#available-connectors) that are not installed by default---users need to choose which connectors to install based on their available
data sources. Let's install the connector for our Sysmon-Elasticsearch(ECS)
data pipeline:

```bash
$ pip install stix-shifter-modules-elastic_ecs
```

Often, one would monitor many Windows with logs stored in Elasticsearch.
Usually, people assign different Elasticsearch indexes for logs from different
hosts monitored to query them individually.  In Kestrel, we add and configure
data sources we would like to connect to when we are performing our hunts.
Each configuration specifies one or more monitored Windows host(s), which is
identified by the Elasticsearch indexes.  The configuration also tells Kestrel
how to access the Elasticsearch service with hostname and credentials, such as
passwrods or API keys.

We open a new terminal, activate the Python virtual environment with Kestrel,
and export three environment variables to setup a Kestrel data source named
`host101` (more information can be found at [Kestrel
tutorial](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#kestrel-jupyter):

```bash
$ . huntingspace/bin/activate
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTOR=elastic_ecs
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONNECTION='{"host":"elastic.securitylog.company.com", "port":9200, "indices":"host101"}'
$ export STIXSHIFTER_HOST101_CONFIG='{"auth":{"id":"VuaCfGcBCdbkQm-e5aOx", "api_key":"ui2lp2axTNmsyakw9tvNnw"}}'
```

### Starting Jupyter And Create A New Huntbook

Next just start Jupyter notebook in the above terminal with our Kestrel data
source configuration (exported environment variables):

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

On the Jupyter page in a browser, we create an empty Kestrel huntbook by choosing
the *Kestrel* kernel under the dropdown menu of *New Notebooks*.

![Kestrel Jupyter New Huntbook](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_new_huntbook.jpg)

A [Kestrel
huntbook](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#hunt-book) is
a Jupyter notebook that contains hunting steps (in
[Kestrel](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html)), the
execution results, and documentation or comments (in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). In each notebook cell, we can put
any number of consecutive Kestrel statements/commands to be executed together, which forms a Kestrel
code block. After executing each cell, the Kestrel runtime
will give a summary of new variables created in that cell and statistics on
associated logs/records retrieved and cached by the runtime. Notebook cells can
be re-executed or executed out of order in the notebook. Jupyter will give an
execution ID to the left to the cell to indicate the execution order of cells. Note
that if one or more Kestrel variables in a cell depend on the execution of
another cell, the dependent cell or code block needs to be executed first, or
Kestrel will give an error that the variable does not exist in the current
session. Check out the [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for more details on the Jupyter environment.

### Getting The List of Windows Schedulers

In this hunt, we will start drilling down from the list of Windows scheduled
tasks/services to hunt persistent threats like
[FIN7](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046/). In recent Windows (>= Windows
10 version 1511), scheduled tasks are executed and managed by `svchost.exe`
with a specific argument `-k netsvcs -p -s Schedule`. Tasks are spawned from
the `svchost.exe` processes as child processes at scheduled time. This
understanding written by [Nasreddine
Bencherchali](https://nasbench.medium.com/) in his
[blog](https://nasbench.medium.com/a-deep-dive-into-windows-scheduled-tasks-and-the-processes-running-them-218d1eed4cce)
provides the idea to retrieve Windows scheduled tasks as process entities with the parent process `svchost.exe`.

In Kestrel, we use the `GET` command to retrieve data from a data source that
matches a given pattern. In this hunt, we are using [STIX
Patterns](http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/stix-v2.0-part5-stix-patterning.html)
since the data source interface we are using is STIX-shifter, which translates
a STIX Pattern into the native query language and translates the results back
to STIX bundles for Kestrel to process.

There are two special items to take care of when writing a STIX pattern in
Kestrel (more detailed in the [GET command
documentation](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#get)):

1. The returned entity type in the `GET` command should always match the
   root-level [STIX Cyber-observable Objects
   (SCO)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html#_Toc16070567)
   type in the STIX pattern.

2. We need to give a time range with `START ... STOP ...` for our first
   pattern. Otherwise, STIX-shifter will default the search for the last five
   minutes, which may not be the time range of interest.

To get the scheduler `svchost.exe`, the straightforward idea to get such
process entities is to match processes with its specific command line using the
following STIX pattern:

```bash
[process:command_line = 'C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule']
```

And we can put the `GET` command in the first huntbook cell to execute:

```elixir
# create Kestrel variable scheduler with the list of scheduler processes
scheduler = GET process FROM stixshifter://host101
            WHERE [process:command_line = 'C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule']
            START t'2021-04-03T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2021-04-04T00:00:00Z'
```

Alternatively, we can write a simpler pattern to match all `svchost.exe`
processes and further filter the results by applying a second pattern on
`command_line`.

```elixir
# first GET going through STIX shifter
svchost = GET process FROM stixshifter://host101
          WHERE [process:name = 'svchost.exe']
          START t'2021-04-03T00:00:00Z' STOP t'2021-04-04T00:00:00Z'
     
# second GET running locally against the returned/cached data from the first command
# no need to specify time range for GET from a Kestrel variable, check doc for more info
scheduler = GET process
            FROM svchost
            WHERE [process:command_line = 'C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule']
```

Kestrel will run the first pattern via STIX-shifter and the
second one locally against the return of the first `GET`. We put the two `GET`
command in one code block since they will always run together.  This might
useful if we want to perform many searches on `svchost.exe` processes and
minimize the queries we have to perform against the backend. Note that at the
time of this writing the first approach will fail due to a [bug in the ECS
STIX-shifter
module](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/issues/641).

### Finding Scheduled Tasks

Executing the above cell, we get 183 `svchost.exe` processes in variable
`svchost`.  Only two of them are scheduler processes captured in variable
`scheduler`.

![Kestrel first block execution results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_svchost_summary.png)

The next step is straightforward: finding the child processes of `scheduler`,
which are the scheduled task processes we are interested.

For relationship resolution, we use Kestrel command `FIND`, which will take
care of record-to-entity processing and prefetch related records for further
drilling down.

To use `FIND`, we look up [the command
syntax](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#find) for the
appropriate relational syntax to use. The documentation also has some examples
such as finding child processes of processes in a Kestrel variable, which is
exactly what we need here.

```elixir
tasks = FIND process CREATED BY scheduler
DISP tasks ATTR name, command_line
```

In the codeblock above, variable `tasks` contains the child processes from
`scheduler`, and we use a display command `DISP` to show the key attributes of
the process entities in `tasks`. For people who are not familiar with process
entities, they can use `INFO tasks` command to print out all attributes and
then `DISP` some of them.

![Kestrel second block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_tasks_summary.png)

The cell takes 8 seconds to run and find 126 task processes as child processes
of the svchost schedulers in `scheduler`. The `DISP` command shows them in a table.

![Kestrel second block execution results](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_tasks_results.png)

From the screenshot above (part of the processes in `tasks`), we see some
unknown processes `amcet.exe`, yet we cannot find information on Google
and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).

### Drilling Down on a Scheduled Task

<!--  -->
We suspect `acmet.exe` is a legitimate IBM process because of the location path, `c:/programdata/ibm/rii/amcet.exe` shown above. We can create a new variable `amcet` with these processes via a `GET` command and investigate further.

We can find executable files associated with the processes
using the `FIND` command but it may not give more information than what we
already get from the `command_line` field. Instead, we can search through the child processes to see if there is anything suspicious, like _PowerShell_ or other known malicious processes. Further, we can find any network traffic and analyze the communication patterns.

Let's drill-down into amcet as a single execution block in our notebook:

```elixir
# get only the amcet processes from all scheduled tasks
amcet = GET process FROM tasks WHERE [process:name = 'amcet.exe']

# find and display their child processes
amcet_child = FIND process CREATED BY amcet
DISP amcet_child ATTR name, command_line

# find and display their network traffic
nt = FIND network-traffic CREATED BY amcet
DISP nt ATTR dst_ref.value, dst_port
```

![Kestrel third block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_amcet_summary.png)

From the execution summary, we get 24 amcet processes, which spawn 45 child processes
and establish 23 network connections.

![Kestrel third block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_amcet_activity_summary.png)

All network traffic shares the same remote IP address `9.148.5.93` (shown according to
our `DISP nt` command with attributes `dst_ref.value` and `dst_port`):

![Kestrel amcet network traffic disp](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_disp_amcet_nt.png)

From our threat intelligence---look it up at the TI tool or enrich the entities
with the TI information directly in the huntflow, which will be discussed in a
future blog---we don't see any sign of compromise of the host.  We may check
the service on `9.148.5.93:443` to confirm this service is not compromised or
malicious. What is more interesting at this moment are the child processes we
found: 45 spawned processes fall into only two categories---`conhost` and
`powershell`---as our `DISP` command shows:

![Kestrel amcet child disp](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_disp_amcet_child.png)

The sensitive process here is the `conhost.exe` with parameters `0xffffffff
-ForceV1`, which can access kernel space and is used in many attacks,
especially [DLL injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/). We need to check the child processes and files
used by all processes in `amcet_child` to get an idea whether something is
tampered with or there are processes with suspicious command lines.

```elixir
# find child processes of amcet_child
amcet_cc = FIND process CREATED BY amcet_child
DISP amcet_cc ATTR name, command_line

# find files read/written/executed by amcet_child
# Kestrel v1.0.8 only resolves the generic relation LINKED into STIX 2.0 references,
# which is limited to execution relation between processes and executables
amcet_f = FIND file LINKED amcet_child
DISP amcet_f ATTR name, parent_directory_ref.path
```

After executing this cell, we see no child processes created by any process in
`amcet_child` (zero entity in `amcet_cc`).

![Kestrel fourth block execution summary](/images/kestrel/2021-07-01_amcet_ccf_summary.png)

There are only two files touched by the processes in `amcet_child` shown from
the `DISP amcet_cc` command, which are just the main executables of the
processes.

### Summary And Stretch Hunts

In this blog post, we show how to get started with the Kestrel Threat Hunting
Languages from instillation to your first hunt: discovering persistent threats
in Windows. We start by finding all scheduled Windows tasks and then drill down
one specific process in search of suspicious activity. Although we didn't find
any persistent threat in the practice, we created a huntbook that can be reused
and revised for future hunts. Checking the persistence of threats is usually
one of the first phases of discovering large APT campaigns, and the [composable
huntflow](https://kestrel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language.html#composable-hunt-flow)
capabilities enables reusing this huntbook large hunts. We only use the `GET`
and `FIND` commands in this hunting practice, which covers one of the two
categories for knowledge codification---pattern matching. In our next blog we
will cover not only pattern matching but also analytics, the combination of
which will be extremely useful in larger hunts.

### Review the OCA Reference Architecture

[See this link](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/documentation#sacm-oca-iacd-diagram) to our current draft of our OCA architecture discussions as we evolve this diagram.

This work positions OCA with other related activities (especially IACD and SACM) so we can ensure we have alignment.

This reference architecture is also serving us as a basis for our planned OCA activities to define the actions/alerts that formulate ontology as part of the OpenDXL Ontology project.
